## Directions 
### Step #1 - Color those classes <br>
This webpage displays the lyrics for a song about apples and bananas. There are already classes on most of the words about apples and bananas, but there is no style for those classes yet. Add two style rules, one that sets a color for the 'apples' class and another that sets a color for the 'bananas' class.
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Add more classes <br>
The final line of the song has no classes on the `<strong>` tags! Add the 'apples' class to the first `<strong>` in that line, and the 'bananas' class to the second `<strong>` in it.
